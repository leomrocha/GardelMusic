The idea of this project was to develop a game that would help me learn to play piano better, was mostly for personal reasons.
(and ultimately other instruments). I focused on the MIDI connection as it was the easiest one (I wanted to do more sound processing but was a matter of available time)

This repository contains all the code, ideas (at least the ones I wrote into the computer and not only on paper) and interfaces
that I developed for different tests.

Many of these I think are actually great as they came of a long research time doing different kinds of evaluations 
and hundreds of written pages (paper prototypes)

This project contains 2 main things:

A set of Python experiments that interface with a MIDI device (I used to do it with a MIDI over USB) demo text games, format prototypes, etc
Unity (C#) code with corresponding UIs of different experiments.

It worked at that time on my laptop and this repo used other two that I made publicly available at the time 
 - [RtMidi Unity Wrapper](https://github.com/leomrocha/RtMidi-Unity-Wrapper)
 - [RtMidi C Wrapper](https://github.com/leomrocha/rtmidi-c-wrapper)
 
 From now on I release this repository code (all that can be without any conflict) with the MIT license
